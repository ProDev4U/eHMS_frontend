Now the main CRUD operation has finished.

I'll continue & correct it after checking your idea.

As for @ mark, U must consider it deeply, especially update delete.

If not it'll become confusing.

What I mean is the patient or doctor can do it without other's permission. 
 
There are 2 options u can choose:  

	one: CRUD with both doctor & patient's permission -> here  u think how to update the record: origin overwrite or new record create
       
	two: without permission, U can record all history about crud operation

In my opinion, one is better for database size or simple.

I want to hear ur suggestion

 

1. Profile 

  - what kinda data is needed for admin, doctor, patient profile 
	
	o eg: name, email, avatar...
 
2. seizure

  - what kinda data is needed? 
  
  - about role
    
   patient can add(: record new log) delete, update, read
   @consider delete & update when doctor has already show & give a diagnose

   doctor  can only show  about his patient's data

   admin can only show all patient's data

3. Medication

  - what kinda data is needed? 
  
  - about role
    
   patient can show & update only state which means how many does the patient eat medicine -> in short only records taking pill state & can't any change delete about the doctor's diagnosis

   the doctor can create a new diagnosis & update delete except the patient's taking pill state about his patient
   @consider about update delete when the patient has already use this diagnosis more than once

   admin only shows all patients' records

4. checkups

  - what kinda data is needed? 
  
  - about role
    
   the patient can only show his patient data

   the doctor can add delete update read
   @consider update delete -> receive patient permission

   admin only shows all patient's data

5. appointment

   - what kinda data is needed? 

   - role
     patient can read create update delete
     @consider update delete under doctor's permission? 

     doctor can only read, not create

     admin only show

6. Schedule
  - data field
  
  -role

   admin, doctor, patient only own schedule create read update delete 

7. chat
8. dashboard
